In the past year and a half, my husband and I have paid off over $15,000 of credit card and auto debt that we slowly accrued while I was a stay-at-home mom. We were looking forward to paying the rest off by springtime, but both of our well-worn cars (over 230K miles each!) have bitten the dust within two weeks of each other. Except for a small emergency fund, all of our extra income has gone toward debt repayment, so we don’t have enough cash on hand to replace both cars at once. Standard auto loans require that the cars be 2003 or newer, and that we spend at least $7,500 on each—but that’s way more than we need or want to borrow! My credit score is excellent, so the interest rate they’ve offered is good, but I’m hoping to demonstrate for my kids some good old fashioned fiscal responsibility—by minimizing debt and working toward a more secure financial future. We’ve researched our local market, and have found that a $5000 loan-- combined with the cash we have-- will purchase two older but highly reliable cars that, if not too pretty, will get us through our daily work and school commutes safely and reliably.

I would rather not give out the exact location details of which dealership but if you check online you will see the storage package I plan on getting.  Again, I thank you tremendously for asking questions. I had actually wrote a long loan description last friday night but for some reason Lendingclub never updated it on my loan homepage. In any event, for the last 6 years I have been very comfortable as co-owner and Chief Operating Officer of a 35 year old family owned wholesale/retail operation on the North Shore of Long Island. We have managed to weather out the last 3 years of economic turmoil on long island and maintain 5 year back revenue figures which leads me to my next line. God bless, I am currently in a very positive place in my life and finally know the time is right to apply for a loan like this and instead of buying my bike outright pay over 3 years.

With $1000.00 I can pay off a couple of my smaller high interest credit cards and apply the minimum amount, once used to pay those two, plus the minimum I would usually apply towards the higher balance cards.

My mentor/manager asked me to help cover some advertising costs by using my CC.  He failed to deliver on his promises to pay it off swiftly.  Several years later,  I seldom  hear from him.  So paying this off fully, not just covering the minimum payment, is my responsibility and personal mission.  My credit card company cannot reduce my rate b/c I voluntarily shut the card down a few years ago.  They suggest that I go through their debt managemtent solution to set up a plan.  But I can't go to a 'Debt Modification' arrangement b/c I'm in the financial services industry, and that would be a problem for future job disclosure forms, etc.  So I am looking to get ahead of my interest payments, so as to actually begin reducing the principal significantly.  By having a lower rate, the $500-700/month for this loan will dramatically increase the proportion of my payment which is paying down principal.   My financial situation:  I am a good candidate for this loan because my take home pay varies b/t 2,500 and 3,500 per month due to various components of my pay structure.  One component is an override from my entire office's revenue [that began in Oct 07], due to my integral involvement with many other associates' accounts.  After my job change in 2005, aroundthe same time as Hurricane Katrina, my income took a big hit.  But over the last 2+ year it has increased nearly 50% each year.  As thing are today, I am on pace to make at least $40,000 gross in 2008.  Any new accounts/clients/revenue are on top of this $40,000 income base.  My expenses are fairly low considering.  No car payment, low rent, gas is taken care of.  And ultimately, as a Certified Financial Planner, I would never allow my own finances to go into default or bankruptcy because my career would be finished.

This is because their credit is bad and wanted a lower APR. They make payment for this each and every month. I also have a rental property that I owe with my sister and brother. We split all payments equally and set aside in a seperate bank account. The total is about $200 monthly after rent is collected.

I would very much rather owe one institution/lender than several.  This way I could also save on my car insurance, by not having to have full-coverage.    Also, I do get paid cash but this has not affected my credit score since I have paid on time, not going to say always because there were two instances where I paid late, but not later than 15 days past the due date, and this was over a year.    I'm responsible and in no manner will I misuse the money.  I'm a college graduate, hence why I'm in debt, I used my credit cards for tuition, books, gas, meals, and supplies.  I don't want to damage my credit, so debt consolidation is out of the question, so is bankruptcy.  I don't believe in the easy way out, regardless the situation I made a conscious choice to use my credit cards even though it was for college.

It's a vicious cycle that is wearing me out. <br/>I would like to have this loan paid off quicker than 3 years. I hope to make extra payments. I doubt that's what a lender wants to hear because they would lose that extra income but i'm just trying to be honest. Paying off this loan would be a huge weight off my shoulders.<br/>My other monthly expenses include $200/mon rent, car insurance and cell phone bill. On top of my full-time job at Base-Line (where I have been for 4 years) I also work part-time at a Skydiving operation packing parachutes.  =)<br/> Borrower added on 06/30/10 > Thank you to everyone who has invested in me so far!

I also run my own web design business, which has become more successful and I am looking to expand -- purchase more equipment, and hire one web developer to work with me.  I decided to get a loan for two reasons:   1) to provide a safety net for me to expand my business. I am currently getting larger projects than I have in the past, and I will need to get another person to help me finish them. Once these projects are done, this investment should pay for itself.  2) I want to establish a lending history with installment loans so that in the future, banks will be able to lend me greater amounts than I am asking for now.  Over the past five years, I have always paid my credit cards on time and that earned me ... well, a score of 729 on Experian, (766 and 768 on TransUnion and Equifax), so I guess you can see I'm a pretty low risk.

The best place to start is how I got into the debt to begin with. It wasn't due to irresponsible spending on the pleasures of life.  One credit (@ $4900) card was used to help my mom, who was laid off over a year ago get her prescriptions.  They ran about $500 a month.  The other card (@ $3800) was at $5K and was opened to put new carpets in my mom's house because the other carpets had been in the house for over 30 years.  Was she supposed to help pay this off once she got a job?  Yes.  However, in this economy a job for someone in their mid 50's with good pay is hard to come by.  The final card (@ $950) is my one card that I use to get by, if I need to.  I don't have to include this card but since I asked for $10K I might as well pay that one off too...

The interest rates on my cards aren't that bad, as my credit score and history are excellent, but lately with the current financial tom-foolery going on I've been thinking a lot about our banking system.  I decided if someone is going to make a profit lending ME money, I'd rather it be real people rather than a bunch of rich fat-cat in a fancy office skimming off the top.  So, I'm collecting my credit card debt (the debt that I don't have at 3.9% fixed for the life of the balance) into one payment.  I take my debt very seriously, and have had revolving credit lines in good standing since I was 16 (a $300 balance capital one credit card!).  I have been with my current job since 1998.  My bills primarily consist of a car loan, and a few credit card bills.  My wife and I have housing paid for by our company (she works with me), so we have a very good debt to income ratio and put as much as we can into savings every month.    I've considered using our savings to pay down debt, but up until recently we were making more in investments than we were paying in interest.  We'll see what the future holds.  I'd pay off corporate debt before I'd pay off this LendingClub loan (which only has a three year term, which is a fairly insignificant amount of time in the big picture).

Due to the state of the economy several years ago, I was using credit cards with 0% balance transfer offers and no fee to carry the debt. Moving the funds around as such is no longer quite as feasible. I would like to move away from having several different payments on multiple cards with fluctuating rates, due dates, etc. I am currently employed as a Corporate Disbursements Manager and have been with the same organization for six years.

I teach music at my wife's school for autism, Celebrate the Children and also work as a recording engineer. I have a steady income. We recently adopted siblings from Kazakhstan (brother and sister). I have been diagnosed with bilateral osteo necrosis of the hip joints. This means that the blood supply to the tips of my femurs was somehow compromised and has left me with lesions of dead bone. Traditional medicine would have me wait until this dead bone collapses and then get  hip replacements. Since the replacements are only good for 5 -7 years, I would have to have this done multiple times, if I live a long life. Last fall I had an ""experimental"" procedure performed on my right hip. The procedure involves drawing my bone marrow and blood, and from that my own stem cells are harvested. Then these stem cells are re-injected into the problem area of the bone to promote re-growth or at least halt the degeneration. This was done by Dr Centeno at the Regenexx clinic in CO. It seems to have been successful. I now need to have this done on my left hip. The procedure cost $8000 and I only have $4000. I have been turned down by my bank and we spent most of our savings on our adoption process.
