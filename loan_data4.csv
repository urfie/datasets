In the past year and a half, my husband and I have paid off over $15,000 of credit card and auto debt that we slowly accrued while I was a stay-at-home mom. We were looking forward to paying the rest off by springtime, but both of our well-worn cars (over 230K miles each!) have bitten the dust within two weeks of each other. Except for a small emergency fund, all of our extra income has gone toward debt repayment, so we don’t have enough cash on hand to replace both cars at once. Standard auto loans require that the cars be 2003 or newer, and that we spend at least $7,500 on each—but that’s way more than we need or want to borrow! My credit score is excellent, so the interest rate they’ve offered is good, but I’m hoping to demonstrate for my kids some good old fashioned fiscal responsibility—by minimizing debt and working toward a more secure financial future. We’ve researched our local market, and have found that a $5000 loan-- combined with the cash we have-- will purchase two older but highly reliable cars that, if not too pretty, will get us through our daily work and school commutes safely and reliably.

I would rather not give out the exact location details of which dealership but if you check online you will see the storage package I plan on getting.  Again, I thank you tremendously for asking questions. I had actually wrote a long loan description last friday night but for some reason Lendingclub never updated it on my loan homepage. In any event, for the last 6 years I have been very comfortable as co-owner and Chief Operating Officer of a 35 year old family owned wholesale/retail operation on the North Shore of Long Island. We have managed to weather out the last 3 years of economic turmoil on long island and maintain 5 year back revenue figures which leads me to my next line. God bless, I am currently in a very positive place in my life and finally know the time is right to apply for a loan like this and instead of buying my bike outright pay over 3 years.

With $1000.00 I can pay off a couple of my smaller high interest credit cards and apply the minimum amount, once used to pay those two, plus the minimum I would usually apply towards the higher balance cards.

My mentor/manager asked me to help cover some advertising costs by using my CC.  He failed to deliver on his promises to pay it off swiftly.  Several years later,  I seldom  hear from him.  So paying this off fully, not just covering the minimum payment, is my responsibility and personal mission.  My credit card company cannot reduce my rate b/c I voluntarily shut the card down a few years ago.  They suggest that I go through their debt managemtent solution to set up a plan.  But I can't go to a 'Debt Modification' arrangement b/c I'm in the financial services industry, and that would be a problem for future job disclosure forms, etc.  So I am looking to get ahead of my interest payments, so as to actually begin reducing the principal significantly.  By having a lower rate, the $500-700/month for this loan will dramatically increase the proportion of my payment which is paying down principal.   My financial situation:  I am a good candidate for this loan because my take home pay varies b/t 2,500 and 3,500 per month due to various components of my pay structure.  One component is an override from my entire office's revenue [that began in Oct 07], due to my integral involvement with many other associates' accounts.  After my job change in 2005, aroundthe same time as Hurricane Katrina, my income took a big hit.  But over the last 2+ year it has increased nearly 50% each year.  As thing are today, I am on pace to make at least $40,000 gross in 2008.  Any new accounts/clients/revenue are on top of this $40,000 income base.  My expenses are fairly low considering.  No car payment, low rent, gas is taken care of.  And ultimately, as a Certified Financial Planner, I would never allow my own finances to go into default or bankruptcy because my career would be finished.

This is because their credit is bad and wanted a lower APR. They make payment for this each and every month. I also have a rental property that I owe with my sister and brother. We split all payments equally and set aside in a seperate bank account. The total is about $200 monthly after rent is collected.

I would very much rather owe one institution/lender than several.  This way I could also save on my car insurance, by not having to have full-coverage.    Also, I do get paid cash but this has not affected my credit score since I have paid on time, not going to say always because there were two instances where I paid late, but not later than 15 days past the due date, and this was over a year.    I'm responsible and in no manner will I misuse the money.  I'm a college graduate, hence why I'm in debt, I used my credit cards for tuition, books, gas, meals, and supplies.  I don't want to damage my credit, so debt consolidation is out of the question, so is bankruptcy.  I don't believe in the easy way out, regardless the situation I made a conscious choice to use my credit cards even though it was for college.

It's a vicious cycle that is wearing me out. <br/>I would like to have this loan paid off quicker than 3 years. I hope to make extra payments. I doubt that's what a lender wants to hear because they would lose that extra income but i'm just trying to be honest. Paying off this loan would be a huge weight off my shoulders.<br/>My other monthly expenses include $200/mon rent, car insurance and cell phone bill. On top of my full-time job at Base-Line (where I have been for 4 years) I also work part-time at a Skydiving operation packing parachutes.  =)<br/> Borrower added on 06/30/10 > Thank you to everyone who has invested in me so far!

I also run my own web design business, which has become more successful and I am looking to expand -- purchase more equipment, and hire one web developer to work with me.  I decided to get a loan for two reasons:   1) to provide a safety net for me to expand my business. I am currently getting larger projects than I have in the past, and I will need to get another person to help me finish them. Once these projects are done, this investment should pay for itself.  2) I want to establish a lending history with installment loans so that in the future, banks will be able to lend me greater amounts than I am asking for now.  Over the past five years, I have always paid my credit cards on time and that earned me ... well, a score of 729 on Experian, (766 and 768 on TransUnion and Equifax), so I guess you can see I'm a pretty low risk.

The best place to start is how I got into the debt to begin with. It wasn't due to irresponsible spending on the pleasures of life.  One credit (@ $4900) card was used to help my mom, who was laid off over a year ago get her prescriptions.  They ran about $500 a month.  The other card (@ $3800) was at $5K and was opened to put new carpets in my mom's house because the other carpets had been in the house for over 30 years.  Was she supposed to help pay this off once she got a job?  Yes.  However, in this economy a job for someone in their mid 50's with good pay is hard to come by.  The final card (@ $950) is my one card that I use to get by, if I need to.  I don't have to include this card but since I asked for $10K I might as well pay that one off too...

The interest rates on my cards aren't that bad, as my credit score and history are excellent, but lately with the current financial tom-foolery going on I've been thinking a lot about our banking system.  I decided if someone is going to make a profit lending ME money, I'd rather it be real people rather than a bunch of rich fat-cat in a fancy office skimming off the top.  So, I'm collecting my credit card debt (the debt that I don't have at 3.9% fixed for the life of the balance) into one payment.  I take my debt very seriously, and have had revolving credit lines in good standing since I was 16 (a $300 balance capital one credit card!).  I have been with my current job since 1998.  My bills primarily consist of a car loan, and a few credit card bills.  My wife and I have housing paid for by our company (she works with me), so we have a very good debt to income ratio and put as much as we can into savings every month.    I've considered using our savings to pay down debt, but up until recently we were making more in investments than we were paying in interest.  We'll see what the future holds.  I'd pay off corporate debt before I'd pay off this LendingClub loan (which only has a three year term, which is a fairly insignificant amount of time in the big picture).

Due to the state of the economy several years ago, I was using credit cards with 0% balance transfer offers and no fee to carry the debt. Moving the funds around as such is no longer quite as feasible. I would like to move away from having several different payments on multiple cards with fluctuating rates, due dates, etc. I am currently employed as a Corporate Disbursements Manager and have been with the same organization for six years.

I teach music at my wife's school for autism, Celebrate the Children and also work as a recording engineer. I have a steady income. We recently adopted siblings from Kazakhstan (brother and sister). I have been diagnosed with bilateral osteo necrosis of the hip joints. This means that the blood supply to the tips of my femurs was somehow compromised and has left me with lesions of dead bone. Traditional medicine would have me wait until this dead bone collapses and then get  hip replacements. Since the replacements are only good for 5 -7 years, I would have to have this done multiple times, if I live a long life. Last fall I had an ""experimental"" procedure performed on my right hip. The procedure involves drawing my bone marrow and blood, and from that my own stem cells are harvested. Then these stem cells are re-injected into the problem area of the bone to promote re-growth or at least halt the degeneration. This was done by Dr Centeno at the Regenexx clinic in CO. It seems to have been successful. I now need to have this done on my left hip. The procedure cost $8000 and I only have $4000. I have been turned down by my bank and we spent most of our savings on our adoption process.

An elective surgery that I have elected to have.  My co-pay is approx 10K.  I found out last year due to some mild hip discomfort that I have congenital hip dysplasia (yes like dogs but people get it too).  The joints are slowly starting to deteriorate due to the abnormal stress of dysplasia.  If I do nothing I will be in hip replacement in 5-10 years, which I am too young for.  If I have the surgery it will correct the defect and keep me out of hip replacement possibly for good or at least for another 20-25 yrs. I have done a TON of research and am making a very well informed decision.  I am a terrific candidate for this loan because I have excellent credit, a long-term stable job and little to no debt.  I do not live beyond my means and have a small nest egg in IRAs that I have been working on (enough to cover this loan if necessary).  As a matter of fact I may end up using a part of my IRA to pay back the medical portion of this loan as you can use IRA contributions for a percentage of your medical expenses with no tax penalties.

My goal is to create a tutoring website that is free for all students. Grade school, High school and College.

I'm not trying to take anything away from current traditional tutors. I've needed a tutor when I was younger and I was a tutor while in college. Tutors are truly invaluable. My aim is to simply help students who can't afford a private tutor. I already have the business plan completed and the domain name purchased. The money that you loan me will go towards building the website. The goal is to have it open and running by the beginning of 2012. This is my first time trying to start a business and I'd be happy to listen to any advice that you may have. Thank you for your time and contribution.

With the drought in financing to acquire homes I have lately been buying mobile homes located in mobile home parks with cash and renting them out.  I buy the mobiles with my cash and rehab them. Once the home is completed and filled with a tenant or tenant/buyer I obtain a private lending loan to recover my cost and to move on to the next project.  This loan would cover my acquisition and rehab cost for the property. The tenant pays a weekly rent of $120 a week. The lot rent is $170 a month. This property cash flows approximately $350 a month averaged out over the course of a year leaving plenty of room for a loan of $5000.  My Experience:  I have acquired over 50 properties in the past 3 years and run a property management company that manages over 150 units in the Northwest Georgia area.  I have raised over $500,000 in private money for acquiring single family homes over the past 3 years and continue to do so. I can provide documentation of security deeds for mortgages from my private lenders and the cancellations showing that the loans were paid off.  I have two full time contractors that work for me and rehab the properties that we acquire and we quickly fill most all of our units.  My private money website for the single family homes is located at http://www.privatedollar.com. My management company's website is located at http://www.picksimple.com.  Please note that my credit rating may seem risky however in general my score is most affected by my debt to income. I have several mortgages on my report in addition the income on my tax returns being lower due to the number of deductions I take from my business so please keep that in mind.  There are no late payments and I can provide references of private lenders who my local area who will verify my timely payments and also references of lenders who have loaned me money before and that I have paid off.  Thank you and I look forward to working with you.

I understand the importance of making payments on time and I also understand that my credit card debt is not going anywhere if I only make the on time payments.  Consider my Chase Mortgage as a representation of my desire to have strong credit.  For a three month period I made 1/4 the monthly income that I normally would have due to the aftermath of Hurricane Ike.  It was tight, but I would not accept not being able to pay as agreed.  I deal with way too many people day to day that cant get what they want because they didnt take care of their credit.  To sum it up, my Grandad once told me ""if you pay your bills and take care of your credit you wont ever go hungry"".  He also said ""if you cant pay cash then dont buy it"", but we cant all be just like our Grandad.

We figure it is time to do this as the efficiency of the existing furnace would see us literally burning money this Winter. We've saved one thousand dollars for the project and would save more but the Winter is right around the corner here in New England. I've calculated that the efficiency savings more than make up for the interest rates offered here.   Both of us have unblemished credit histories.. My wife is currently pregnant and will be taking maternity leave in February. Ordinarily, we would pay cash for a project like this but her company does not offer paid maternity leave. We are saving like crazy so she can be guaranteed a minimum of three months at home with our child. We're up to two months and hopefully will get more.

I am looking to reduce my interest rate and monthly payments and see the monthly progress of my debt repayment rather than being stuck in the same place month after month as a result of high finance charges and fees.   My current credit card debt is inhibiting my ability to successfully implement strategies to enable me to grow my company. I am married with a wife and 2 kids. I am honest and have always paid my bills on time. I just need a little help right now.   Now the details...  We are an IT consulting company working with small businesses in the San Diego area. I started the company in 2003 and now have a total of 3 employees. In order to grow to the next level, I have started working ON my business instead of IN my business. This has required me to reallocate my time and resources to develop a consistently profitable business model. While I have a viable customer base, I’ve had to reinvent myself and my company to accommodate the need to grow my company. The “one man” shop mentality and working on break fix issues will not allow my company to grow to the next level.  I have developed a profitable business model, which is based on recurring revenue. A tremendous benefit for my customer is the ability to budget their normally un-predictable computer/network costs. Using a flat fee, “all you can eat” support model paired with a software technology which enables me to provide 24/7/365 monitoring of all critical networking devices and remedy issues remotely. This allows me to have a consistent revenue stream for my company and benefits my customers by saving lost revenue due to unpredictable downtime.   In addition, we have created a state of the art Business Continuity Solution to prevent disasters of data. It’s also based on a recurring revenue model which provides customers the ability to keep working if their server(s) goes down for whatever reason.  Overall, my new business model is a proactive solution to managing a company’s IT infrastructure (computers, servers, router, etc…) A typical “computer” company spends a lot of time and effort in a reactive break/fix model. We are able to proactively manage a computer network to prevent the problems before they become an issue.  The new business model includes a few different components:  1.	Marketing: Most business I’ve had has been word of mouth referral. I am now able to target customers who benefit from a proactive solution. This requires a comprehensive marketing strategy with multiple touch points from multi-step campaigns to lunch and learn seminars. To that end, I have hired a marketing expert who specializes in marketing for IT companies like mine. I now have 3 step marketing campaigns, tech tip postcards, and a wealth of other marketing material that will enable me to reach numerous new customers.  2.	Helpdesk: I have now implemented a fully staffed helpdesk with process and procedures to resolve customer issues using a complete software system. This software application manages my billing, invoicing, Customer resource management, time entry, scheduling, accounting, email, and project management, all in one tool. It has increased my efficiency and capabilities to handle larger volumes of customers. It’s a tool to help get the next level.  3.	Personal Growth: I have had to change my personal mentality from being a computer tech to an entrepreneur who manages a growing company.  I appreciate your time and please feel free to contact me for questions.  Thanks for your consideration.

These proceeds will be used to hire the attorney and to stabilize my financial affairs.  As an additional fund-raising action, and as a risk mitigating hedge against this loan, I am also in the process of refinancing my condominium.  Its appraised value was $267,000 in 12/2006.  The target proceeds are $5,000 - $20,000.  The actual amount will depend on property appraisal.  My condo is in ""North Bethesda, MD""... approx. 4 miles North of Bethesda (an appreciating to stable market) and 6 miles South of Rockville (designated a declining market).  The need to borrow is created by timing.  I estimate that the current value of the divorce assets is approximately $200,000.  My ex-wife and I were married in the State of NC.  NC law indicates an equitable distribution should apply.  The goal is to invest up to $20,000 in hiring a competent divorce attorney to achieve the $100,000 in assets.    The assets from the divorce will be used to settle all debts.  Remaining proceeds would start a retirement fund, begin investments and be used to fund additional education.

My goal is to purchase our first home within six months and credit card utilization plays a big part in FICO scoring. An installment account is scored differently than CCs and this loan would result in a big bump in our FICO scores and thus place us in a better position to get a lower rate.<br/><br/>To summarize my credit reports, all are the same with up to a 13 year history (depending on the report) with an average age of approx 3-4 years. I don't know how much info you can see, but I have a total of 20 accounts on TransUnion with all but 5 being current and open with zero lates. The closed accounts include three closed and paid (in good standing) CCs that were closed due to higher rates and/or fees, and two car loan accounts. Both car loans are paid in full, with the latest being last spring and one followed me from a dark period in my credit history and was a redeemed repo. After the repo, I paid past due amounts and continued until paid in full and that was over 4 yrs ago. The repo occurred over 5 yrs ago with lates leading up to that. I believe there are seven 30 and 60 day lates reporting with the last being 1/2005. Other than that I have no other bad accounts reporting, including no judgments, collections, etc. <br/><br/>Per new credit, I have 8 inquiries reporting on TransUnion but all of them, except for one, are older than 1 yr old and are about to drop from the credit report. The most recent inquiry is 8-9 months old. This is my first and only attempt at a loan.<br/><br/>My monthly income is at $5,260 and I've been with the same company since May of 1997. I worked my way up and have served as president since the start of the year. We are in the commercial services industry (janitorial, security, landscaping, supply sales, etc.) since 1978 and are rebounding at $1.7M/yr, debt free, BTW. Not included in the stats are household income. My wife is a stay-at-home mom to 4 kids, but she earns income by serving on the board for our company. That income is at about $22k/yr. Aside from that, we earned an extra $5300 in reported misc. income last year. <br/><br/>Per DTI, our monthly obligations are the rent ($1000) and CC payments.<br/><br/>Per cash reserves, we have about $2000 in cash available at all times with $35k in a CD saved for our future home. We also have just over $20k in a 401(k).<br/><br/>One question I'd ask is why so much debt and why is your CC utilization so high? Over the past year, my wife didn't have (well, we didn't have) health insurance. Despite that, come 2 weeks ago, kiddo #4 came and we paid the hospital in cash. Felt great, but I used CCs as a crutch over the past many months. To compund things, I had over $8000 in credit with DSNB (Macys and Bloomies) and they made a change in CC reporting and stopped reporting the credit limits. That shot my CC utilization up by 35% overall in one day. Thankfully, I only had balances on two of the accounts, one of which recently got paid off and has yet to report. Last year, I added an Amex Green and funnelled all purchases on that card. That forces me to pay in full monthly all the while chipping away at the remaining CC balances (approx 10 of 20 accounts have balances). <br/><br/>I probably typed too much, but wanted to be thorough.<br/> Borrower added on 07/09/10 > I wanted to give an update...I called today and they had already received everything they needed.

As luck would have it, I was both mugged and knocked out my two front teeth during this time. As a result, I had to finance the bills from these two accidents by charging them to my credit cards. I am now paying the price by incurring high interest from these large credit corporations.   I am at a point in my life where I would like to buy a home, get married, and eventually have children.

Current interest rates range for 12.90% to 26.99%. I will also be paying off the balance of my car of $14,900.00 with a payment of $683.00. Total of all debt to be paid off is $33,900.00 at payments at $1,188.00.<br/>Payment on the new loan should be $880.00 which shows a monthly debt savings of $308.00 per month, I should be able to apply this savings towards the new loan to shorten the term from 5 years to somewhere around 3.5 to 4 years.<br/>  <br/>What makes me a good borrower? I make a decent income of about $115,000.00 per year selling new homes for a large builder in a market that&rsquo;s been down but is now on its way back. While the housing market has been soft I have not had a decree in my income and my credit has not suffered. The large part of the debt is from my ex-wife which I took to help her knowing that she would not be able to pay which could affect my credit. I have never been late making payments on any of my debts and intend to keep it that way.<br/><br/>With this new loan my budget is simple, my mortgage payment is $1,780.00 and the new loan of $880.00 totals $2,660.00. My monthly income before taxes is around $9,400.00 per month so after my monthly obligations of $2,660.00 leaves me over $6,700 for living expenses, savings and investments. The main goal for this loan is to get out from under the credit card lenders and their high rates as well as getting the debts from my ex wife paid off.<br/>  <br/>Regarding my job stability, last year was one of my highest income years since I have been in the new home building market, 9 years total and each year is better for me.

Status:Fully Paid,n,,"What a terrible problem for your borrower to have!  I make too much money to qualify for the down payment assistance programs in my area.  I only began my professional career a couple years ago, and spent the first two years aggressively paying off the debts that I incurred as a nursing student.     Now, as a fully employed professional working in a recession proof industry, I am ready to start looking for a first house, but I haven't had the opportunity yet to save an adequate down payment.  There are some very good deals to be had in my area, and I plan to borrow responsibly and only buy as much house as I can afford.    There are grant programs and special urban redevelopment loans that help people in my position, but I make too much money to qualify.  The amount I am seeking is only a part of the down payment I would like to offer, and honestly, I could probably wait just a few months and save it.  But every month I wait, I am paying rent that is almost twice what my modest mortgage payment would be.  So, taking out this small loan to help this deal go through will end up saving money.  I'm a good risk, with less than $250 in credit card debt, no automobile debt, very minimal student loan debt.   Basically, I will only have my mortgage and this loan to repay.

I have paid off 3 cars, 2 personal loans, and 1 student loan. <br/><br/>Most recently, using my work bonus and tax return, I paid off 2 more credit cards, 1 student loan, and my wife's car.<br/><br/>The existing credit card balance is a result of balances being transferred from my parent's debt due to them &quot;winging&quot; my younger brother's college and medical expenses (cancer treatment). <br/><br/>Being that they are retired with limited income, combined with the fact that my younger brother had already maxed out his financial aid and had no medical insurance, they could not take out a consolidation loan on their own.<br/><br/>As they are nearly 70 years old, I did not want them to have to go back to work.  Ideally, I would have preferred to take out a home equity loan since my home was valued at just over 225K when I purchased it.  I had paid this down considerably since then, but recently refinanced it due to much lower rates (nearly 4% lower than my original rate). During the refinance process, I found out that due to current market conditions my home only appraised at 172K . <br/><br/>Although I still owe 137K on the house, I assumed that I could take out 35K from the remaining equity - however, in Texas, you can only take out 70% of your home's total equity (appraised value).  <br/><br/>24,500 was not enough to consolidate debt AND make renovations to my kitchen and bathroom - a friend of mine told me about LendingClub and thought that I would give a try. <br/><br/>I am an excellent low-risk investment and a strong ROI potential because I have good, extensive credit and employment history with absolutely no blemishes on my record. I also have a home that will only gain (re-gain) value over time. <br/><br/>Thank you for considering my loan.

I put most of my savings into my 20% down payment on the house, and used lines of credit to do things like furnish it and start some necessary renovations.<br/><br/>Now that that's all done, I've done a review of my finances, and I'm confident I could pay off every cent of debt I have in about three years without much effort. However, by going through lending tree, why, I should be able to do the same in under two years and still keep a comfortable cushion in case something goes wrong in this bad economy...<br/><br/>To instill confidence in my as a borrower, please note that I have a graduate degree in engineering, own my car outright, and have paid off my student loans entirely. I currently fully fund my 401(k) and IRA every year. I also have about a bit over $80,000 worth of equity in my home to date. Help me out with a lower interest rate than banks would give for a personal loan!<br/>",debt_consolidation,Another take on Credit Card Reform ,770xx,TX,7.84,0.0,Jun-98,0.0,,,16.0,0.0,35144.0,58.40%,32.0,f,0.0,0.0,4995.564026,4856.8,4500.0,495.56,0.0,0.0,0.0,Dec-13,143.89,,Jun-18,0.0,,1.0,Individual,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cash,N,,,,,,

Each website currently sells just under 600 products ranging from items for the home, personal health, body building, and pet supplies. Of these, 20 to 25 items account for 35% of our total sales. Future websites will be stream lined to specific customer goals and interests to take advantage of this.   With an aggressive SEO plan utilizing such tools as Google analytics, we have seen a steady increase in visitors and sales, primarily from the United Kingdom and Germany with North America being responsible for just under 25% of current activity.  Our goal at this time is to take advantage of our best selling products. We plan on being even more aggressive on pricing so will need to purchase larger quantities from our vendors in order to lessen the cost and raise our profit margin.

My brand new wife and I are spending our time getting our financial future set up and combined together.  Recently we have been looking into P2P as a neat way to invest, this loan would be to get started doing just that.     We have been living together for over a year and have quite an extensive income, but since we have combined our debt and I can only count my income, my DTI looks high.  With her income paying all her portion of the college bills, her car, her credit she has brought to the table, my DTI is 18% and this can be documented if you require details.  My debt was much lower before taking on the cost of her debt.  We are managing it comfortably, but require another year to lower the total balances.  I earn approximately $10500 a month and my wife brings home another $3300 so you don't have any concerns about getting your money back if someone defaults on me.   Good Bidding!

I ended up with $5,000 in tax debt. I had some savings to pay a large part  of this debt, but unfortunately my husband had to have an unexpected surgery in April, depleting our savings and leaving us with almost $2,000.00 in medical bills. I have made payment agreements with both the IRS and our medical provider but the monthly payments are putting very tight constraints on our monthly cash flow. I am looking to refinance this debt for a short term (36 months at much lower monthly payments) in order to create some space in our monthly cash flow and and allowing us to stay current on our 2010 quarterly estimated tax payments as well as build up savings for future unexpected expenses. This loan would not be additional debt, we are looking to convert some high monthly payments into more manageable monthly payments.<br/><br/><br/>My approximate monthly budget :<br/><br/>Income: $8,600.00 +/- (net of business expenses including health/dental insurance and tax withholding)<br/><br/>Mortgage $2,298.00<br/>Groceries $800.00<br/>Insurance (auto/life) $320.00<br/>Utilities: $650.00 (including internet &amp; cell phone)<br/>Auto/ Fuel $220.00<br/>Childcare: $400<br/>Credit Card Payments: $572.00<br/>Clothing/Personal Items/Personal Care $275.00<br/>Restaurants/Entertainment $125.00<br/>Education: $1800.00<br/>Medical $100.00<br/>Savings $200.00<br/>Other Non-Discretionary $250.00<br/><br/>IRS Tax Debt $500.00/mo<br/>Medical Debt (surgery) $300.00/mo<br/> <br/>These last two payments would be converted into a single $195.00 payment with this loan.<br/><br/>If I am able to reduce my combined IRS and Medical Debt to a much lower payment, that will enable me to run a positive cash flow once again.<br/><br/>I am aware of 2 late payments recorded on my credit report. These are a result of me not updating the accounts on 2 of my automatic payments in a timely manner when one my banks went in to receivership,(and was eventually taken over by another bank.) These accounts are now current. One was on a car payment that has since been paid off. The other was on a rarely used business credit card. I set up most of my payments on an automatic system. I will make sure all account information is up-to-date and accurate on all future automatic payments.<br/><br/><br/>I have had my private practice in speech therapy for over 5 years and have had over 5% growth in net income each year, with about 7% in 2009. Prior to my own practice I worked in the schools for over 5 years. Currently, speech therapists, both locally and nationwide are in high demand.

I have always paid my bills on time and have had low debt, along with a great credit rating for the majority of my life. However, my current high debt is a reflection of a 4 year period when I attended college, paying tuition, books and such.  As a result, I am only indebted to my credit cards. I did not obtain tuition loans. Also, I do not have a car loan or any other debt, just my credit cards.           For the past 2 years, due to an increase in income, I have been able to pay a substantial amount of my debt off.  If you look at my credit report, you can see that I have no delinquent accounts and that I have paid off over $13000 of my debt these past 2 years. At this point, I would like to minimize my interest rate fees in order to contribute more to the principal.Furthermore, I have closed the credit cards that I plan to pay with this loan, which are listed in  my credit report. I have no problem identifying those credit cards and agreeing to a formal agreement to that.                   I would just like to quickly pay all of my credit cards then close all but one of them.

I'm married and my wife has been working for the same employer (medical billing) for the last 25 years.    I'm looking for a loan to consolidate some credit card debt.  My goal is debt-free in 5 years.

We own a home, but plan to sell within a year, so re-financing is not an option (and why should I pay another round of ridiculously over-priced closing costs?).

Prior to the recession, I was a Sales position for Training and Development.   During the recession, with lower commissions, I began using my cards to supplement my income.  The money will be used for reducing my credit card balances into 1 payment at a lower interest rate (currently between 24% - 11%).   With my utilization high (60%), I am not in a position for better terms (i.e. one is 24% interest) nor getting my balances back to zero where they should be.  (I used to have CC balances zero, paid cash for cars).   This loan will also facilitate the higher credit score and the benefits that come with an excellent credit rating.

The property is already sec 8 approved and rentals of 4 bedroom<br/>houses go for $750 a month. With a $4000 downpayment a 10 yr mortgage will be about $120 a month. the area is a up and coming urban developement area and the property values are beginning to creep up.

Both have been paid off.  The first by the insurance company and the second by myself.  I have literally destroyed all of my credit cards and look forward to the day I can be free of all debt.

Try and try as I might to pay down these two credit cards, it is very difficult with the high interest rates I am being charged.  I have more than learned my lesson using Credit.  The cards themselves are shredded and I have tried contacting the card providers directly to request a lower interest rate, but I was told that is just ""isn't possible at this time"".  It is very frustrating to have a $120 minimum payment each month on both cards only to see that there is $90 in interest charged and only $30 applied to the balance.  I am hoping that I will be able to consolidate these two cards down into one lower payment each month.  I am a single father with two children ages 10 and 11, so it is just not possible for me to get a part time job right now due to their age and also all of their school activities.

I purchased windows for my home and thought I was getting a 12 month no interest loan and then pay off the balance with monthly payments with interest. Basically, first year no interest.   It turns out that I needed to pay off the entire $12,610 balance within 12 months or I would have over $3000+ in interest added to the balance. The interest accrued over the first year of no interest. I would then have to make monthly payments on almost $16,0000.   I tried to get the terms adjusted but the company and GE Money placed the responsibility on the other with neither one helping me. I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau concerning their sales tactics but the company did nothing to assist with the loan terms.

I have worked at the same job for 5 years and lived in the same house for 3 years.  Have a letter from our landlord stating that we have been exceptional tenants and have always paid on time he says that we are welcomed back to his rental company anytime.

Status:Fully Paid,n,,"I have been offered a partnership in my downtown Washington, D.C. law firm, but there is a hitch.  My firm is very entrepreneurial and part of its culture is that partners are not paid a salary.  In essence, partners in my firm are paid on a commission basis based on the amount work they do and the amount of business they bring in.  Because partners do not get paid until our clients pay their bills, a new partner must wait at least two months before seeing his/her first check.  Per industry standard practices, the first month of work will not be billed until the beginning of the next month and clients have 30 days (i.e., the beginning of the following month) to pay their bills.  Thus, work done in November is not billed until the beginning of December and is not paid until the beginning of January.  As a result, my next paycheck will not be until next January.  My wife and I are seeking to adopt from a foreign country, which is a long and expensive process.  (It usually takes a few years and costs $20,000 or more per adoptive child.)  As result, we have not been able to save as we would like and we are facing a few more expenses in the next few months.  Although we have already spent most of what we need to complete the adoption, there will be a some expenses (such as international plane tickets and hotel expenses to bring our child home) to pay when the time comes.  My current income is about $132,000 per year.  Because of marketing and other advantages that law partners have over non-partners (i.e., clients are more comfortable doing business with and paying higher rates for partners), I expect my annual income to increase to at least $165,000 per year once I make partner.  I need a loan now, however, to secure the income I will need over the next few months and to give me some time to build my savings and even out the inevitable up-and-down cycles that occur when you depend on commission-based income.  (I would rather get a loan than borrow from my credit cards because credit cards are just too darned expensive.)  One note on the prospects for the legal market:  I have developed legal expertise in different areas that normally exhibit different market trends.  I do a lot of work in complex commercial and employment litigation in federal courts, and I have extensive experience in bankruptcy litigation.  Both litigation and bankruptcy are countercylical (i.e., the work goes up as the economy goes down).  I also advise numerous tax exempt organizations, such as charities, trade associations, and political organizations.  This work tends to grow with the economy and tracks normal business cycles.  Finally, my firm has several competitive advantages, including our location in Washington, D.C.  Federal government services are recession-proof and the businesses in this area (and that come from around the country to lobby or do business here) continue to grow even in the middle of a recession.  That and our ability to deliver high-quality service for a more affordable price makes our firm very attractive even during down times in the economy.  All of these factors mean that our work (and my part of it) should continue to be steady regardless of the economic conditions affecting the country as a whole.  That in a nutshell is my request.  I am looking forward to working with you to make it fruitful both for me and for your investors.",small_business,Partnership Bridge Loan,220xx,VA,15.16,0.0,May-87,0.0,33.0,,8.0,0.0,134025.0,67.90%,16.0,f,0.0,0.0,24214.71803,12125.27,20000.0,4214.72,0.0,0.0,0.0,Jul-11,611.71,Aug-11,Sep-17,0.0,,1.0,Individual,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cash,N,,,,,,

As I mentioned in the title, first part of the loan is for my root canal.  I need to come up with 1900.00 to do root canal for 2 teeth that is currently bringing me a lot of pain. I can't eat too much or hard food. My company just started to offer health insurance for employees 2 months ago. So I thought I can use the benefit to repair my teeth, but I found out that root canal is not covered by the insurance policy. So I have to come up with 1900.00 from my own pocket to fix the teeth and get rid of the pain. But it is an unexpected spending to me, so I am not able to afford 1900.00 at one time. I have saving, but since I still have fixed expenses every month, including rent, phone bill, insurance, credit cards debt ,etc. I don't have that much left to fund the root canal treatment but around 400.00 now.  So I really need you help with the 1600.00 so that I can have my teeth saved in the next two weeks instead of removing them eventually.  For the rest of 5000.00, I am going to use it to consolidate my high interest rate credit cards debt. Although I am able to make payments on each credit card on time monthly, but since the interest rate is not fixed, I still feel insecure to have such debts. And making payments different times a month really frustrates me and I have been trying to find a way to consolidate them. But the interest rate from banks are so high, and even the lowest interest rate for personal loan is still higher than that from my credit cards.   All the credit card debts incurred when I was in college because I did not even have full time job back then and I had to support my life. After I graduated, I have stopped using them for my living expense or paying bills as I know it is not the right way to use them. It is a lesson I have learned, and I have been paying them on time monthly till now. But it seems to me that I have never got ahead of the interest raise. So I really hope I can consolidate them and make payment in a lump sum amount every month. In doing so, I know I am making progress in managing my debt well and I can see the end of the tunnel.   About me, as you may have noticed, I have good credit score, and I have never been late on even 1 payment. I am responsible for what I did. Also, I have worked for a law firm as a paralegal for 3 years, so I have a stale job and  income and am able to make payments.   Thank you again for your help in advance.",other,Borrow to fix teeth and debts,918xx,CA,2.87,0.0,Jan-05,2.0,,,11.0,0.0,8164.0,21.10%,17.0,f,0.0,0.0,7794.541602,7469.78,6600.0,1194.54,0.0,0.0,0.0,Sep-12,218.43,,Jul-15,0.0,,1.0,Individual,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cash,N,,,,,,

I reside and work in San Diego, CA.  I have been with my current employer for over 8 years.  My title is Business Development Manager and we are a software development company.   EXPLANATION OF CREDIT HISTORY:  I had my share of struggles in my younger years (18-21) as I did not understand the importance of fiscal responsibility and maintaining good credit.  I acquired much credit card debt and did not consistently pay my bills on time.  Since then, I have taken great pride in diligently righting my financial wrongs and rebuilding my credit profile.  As you will see in my 5-7 year credit history, I have been successful in consistently maintaining successful credit.  I regularly monitor my credit and consider myself to be very financially aware and responsible.  My current FICO score (updated March 1, 2008) is 667.  My goal is to use this loan to pay off credit card debt and bring my score above 700.  With this loan, I am asking for a chance to completely pay off all credit card and other debt and consolidate into 1 recurring monthly payment.  I promise to all lenders bidding my loan that making my payments on time will be my top priority each month.    Also, as you will see in my financial details below, I have the necessary resources to do this successfully.  This is due in part to a very strong and stable income (mid 6-figure W2 in 2007).  Please also see attached PDF of my 2007 W-2 showing income of over $148,000.   WHAT I WILL DO WITH THE MONEY LOANED TO ME:  I will completely pay off all credit card and recurring monthly debt and consolidate into 1 monthly payment.  The resulting effect will be a strong increase in my credit score as this will vastly improve my percentage of credit available aspect of my credit profile.  Additionally, this will enable me to avoid the costly finance charges I am acquiring each month with these credit cards and to focus only on my monthly payments to Lending Club.  The long-term goal of this loan is to eliminate these other debts, continue my strong payment history, and position myself to purchase my 1st home in the next 2-3 years.   HERE ARE MY MONTHLY FINANCIAL DETAILS:  Net income after payroll deductions from all sources: $6,500.00  EXPENSES Rent: $1,150 Phone: $60 Gas: $20 Electricity & Water: $20 Car Loan and Operating Expenses: $700 Food / Necessities: $200 Insurance: $70 Cable/Internet: $75 Misc expenses, etc. $200 Other: $200 ----------------------- Total Monthly Expenses : $2,695  I will have $3,805 left to make the payments on my loan.   CLOSING REMARKS TO LENDERS:  Thank you for taking the time to review my loan application.  With the assistance of this loan, I will be able to further establish a steady ground for my financial stability and future growth.  I appreciate your consideration and look forward to working with yoy.",debt_consolidation,Personal Loan to Consolidate Debt,921xx,CA,10.14,1.0,Jul-95,1.0,22.0,,9.0,0.0,3608.0,37.60%,20.0,f,0.0,0.0,12309.8865,9316.57,10000.0,2309.89,0.0,0.0,0.0,May-11,102.89,,Jun-16,0.0,,1.0,Individual,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cash,N,,,,,,

A place thriving of independent film makers, production companies, and film studios.  I currently am employed at a job that I have been at for 3 years now.   I am still in the development stages of my business, I have invested 10K of my money from my current job to help build the business (i.e. permit, registrations, equipment, storage)  This is a new business venture for me that I am seeking,  I see the potential in generating a great profit by providing the lowest price's on equipment rental's to draw in customers, and also I have 3 years experience as an Independent film maker as well so I know exactly what products are in high demand, and what products are not.  I have gathered info on potential business competitors, seen their rates, and what they offer, and though I am starting out small, I see myself having a greatly beneficial edge, in that 1, I am very familiar with what equipment customers are in high demand of, and 2, I can produce the lowest rates on rentals to attract new customers to my business.  At my current job, I work evenings, so I plan to work both until my business takes off and shows signs of stability (i.e. 12 months of generating profitable income)  With a 10K loan, I will be able to purchase the sufficient ammount of film equipment needed to begin advertising my company.  The projected annual gross income of this business with the 10K loan is estimated at $21,350, which is based on my current inventory list, and price per item, per month (documentation for this estimate can be provided if requested.)  For the first 1-2 years, my plan is to take all gross profits and 1st, repay any loan(s), and 2nd to invest back into my business to further expand my inventory and reach my goal of doubling my income from year one, and tripling my income for year 3 of business.  With the recession knocking a lot of businesses out, I see this as a great time during our rebuilding phase to get my business to take off. Films are still being made, shows are still running, and there are countless potential customers in independent film makers looking to film their ideas. If for some reason, this business venture does not work out.  The loan can easily be repayed from my current primary job that I have been at for the last 3 years, as I do not plan on quitting that job, until either/or, the loan is repayed, or after a year, the business is still generating a profitable return, and showing signs of stability.  <br/><br/>Thank you for your inquiry in my business venture.<br/>Kelly.<br/> Borrower added on 05/25/10 > With this loan I am requesting, I will be able to purchase the sufficient amount of film equipment needed to begin advertising my company.

He sent subcontractors to build the pool. He got as far as pouring the shell and accepted 4 out of the 5 draws or 95% or the contract price. After taking the 4th draw he disappeared...no returning calls.  When I finally saw him he said the company was bankrupt, he's losing his house and his wife. He also said that I will be receiving liens on my house because he could not pay the sub-contractors for the work they did or the equipment company for their products.  I received two liens totaling more then $11,000 plus it was going to cost me an additional $12K-$15K to finish the pool. (at this point I almost lost my wife:)  After praying for patience with this guy I retained an attorney who negotiated the liens down and they are paid off and decided I would finish the pool on my own.  I completed the work on the pool and passed the final inspection.   The yard is in shambles since they left a nice mess back there.   I am requesting funds to purchase a mini-excavator so I can finish the grading of the property.  Note: I did my due diligence with this contractor and at the time we signed the contract he had a valid contractor license, no complaints with the better business bureau and lives four houses away on a dead end street....who would think this would happen...the moron has to pass my house every day AND his kids go to my son's school...",home_improvement,Contractor robbed me so I will finish it,327xx,FL,10.1,0.0,Jan-94,1.0,,,22.0,0.0,3185.0,2.90%,43.0,f,0.0,0.0,3220.175662,3220.18,2800.0,420.18,0.0,0.0,0.0,Jun-12,99.3,,Oct-17,0.0,,1.0,Individual,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cash,N,,,,,,

I had a 760+ credit score - AA - and DTI of 17% until recently, when an old cell phone account dinged my credit and an Exxon account was closed, dropping me to high 600's.   I am a professional financial consultant in my late-30s (I know how money works) and have been employed with the same firm for the last 12 years and our business remains strong.  My firm offers medical & retirement benefits and incentive comp.   Purpose - Loan Request  This loan will be used to refinish our basement.  We are expecting a baby in the fall and my mother in law is coming to live with us.  This will also add value to our home if we ever decide to sell.  Financial Profile  I actively manage multiple secured and unsecured credit lines, all at low fixed rates, with a flawless 0/0/0 repayment record (except for a cell phone account that never worked and I never used and they tried to charge me), and no delinquencies in over 20 years as a borrower. I have a 4:1 assets to liabilities ratio. Most assets are locked-up in conservative tax-advantaged investments, which could be liquidated if necessary.  Income  My base monthly salary is $9,300 plus incentive comp (still working to achieve Cornellâs alumni average of $150K). Monthly take home is ~ $6,000 after taxes, retirement, insurance, medical, etc.  Monthly Expenses:  Charitable: $400 Mortgage & taxes (5/1 ARM, 4.75% fixed until 2010): $1,691 HELOC (6.5% variable): $200 Food & supplies: $980 Credit card loan payments: $690 (5 cards, from 4.99% to 6.99%, all fixed)  Prosper Loan: $380 (7.0%) Daycare (part time): $250 Car expenses (gas, maintenance): $125 Utilities (gas, electric, phone, water, cable, internet, garbage): $310 Other living expenses (clothes, home improvements, etc.): $125 Student Loan: $118 (3.75% fixed!!!) Insurance (homeowners, life, disability, and auto): $210 Out of pocket medical (co-pays): $40  Total monthly expenses: approx $5,500  Monthly Cash Remaining: approx $500  Conclusion  There is $500+ monthly income remaining to service this loan AND this excludes my wifeâs part-time income and my incentive comp. We both have strong and supportive families. We are stable, careful, conservative, responsible Christians, and live within our means. We donât own boats, motorcycles, SUVs, pool, big-screen TV, or other frivolous depreciating assets.  My volvo 10 years old, my wifeâs is 8 years old; both paid for and running great!  We are working to pay down debt - our mortgage is conventional and we pay towards principal on all other debts each month.  Please contact me if you have any questions, and thank you for considering this request. God Speed!

We already have the entire business plan and marketing plan ready to show to investors so you know your investment will be returned. In that business plan you'll find conservative sales estimates built from the ground up and a gross profit margin of 89-92%.   Currently we have a location ready on the main street in the U-District and are awaiting financing in order to make an offer on the space. There are no other dance clubs in the U-District where 18+ students and residents can attend. Furthermore, there are no other venues that serve Hookah. We have an untapped market with over 45,000 daily attendees in our target market with even more in the local area.  Our executive team includes Sean, a UW business graduate who is currently helping grow Seattle based marketing company, also a startup. He has extensive marketing education and experience promoting to the target market. Sean has a credit score of 720 and has never made a late payment on any of his loans. Our other founder, also named Sean, has a technical background and extensive experience running a hookah lounge in another college-based venue in Bellingham, WA. Our third member is also a business graduate and a DJ from Chicago, with over 200 shows in the mid-west scene.  Our payback period is conservatively 12-18 months in order to help cashflow, but anticpate repayment within 10-12 months.  The bulk of the requested loan will go to working capital and a 4 month lease reserve, together ~$16,400. The remaining funds will go toward inventory, furniture, and a sound system. Because the club operates only from 8pm-2am, Thursday-Saturday, both founders will remain in their current full time employment to ensure additional cashflow if needed.  Our goal is to soft-open on August 28th with a grand-opening on September 19th, 2009.

With a loan from The Lending Club, the forecast is clear as to when the debt could actually be paid off.<br/>My previous loan of 3k from The Lending Club has allowed me to pay off a higher interest credit card, and pay back the loan without racking up huge finance charges that is associated with credit cards. My first loan (#463044) for $3,000 at 11.83% was borrowed and approved in December of 2009, and will be paid in full in March of 2011.<br/> I&rsquo;m making a request to borrow 35k to rid myself once and finally of all credit card and lines of credit debt that is associated with impossible interest rates.<br/>All requested income verification and other necessary documentation have been sent to The Lending Club.<br/>The steps being taken to get spending in line with my income is getting a lower interest rate to pay off debt faster, paying more towards my principal on my mortgage, more hours at work, and my pay increase in March and July 2011.<br/>My monthly commitments are: (Mortgage: $1584, Utilities: $170, Truck Lease: $502, Insurance: $200). My balances on my proposed pay-off debts are: (Wells Fargo: $6,427.70 at an interest rate of 23.99%), (Wells Fargo: $7078.70 at an interest rate of 27.99%), (Bankcard Services: $5774.41 at an interest rate of 17.99%), (Direct Merchants Bank: $4854.39 at an interest rate of 27.99%), (Lowes: $2257.86 at an interest rate of 26.99%), and (Dell: $1039.72 at an interest rate of 24.99%). <br/>The balances on these accounts weren&rsquo;t made due to a spending spree. Most were due to the purchase of inventory, business computers, and credit card equipment. My attempt at opening a women shoes/accessories store didn&rsquo;t pan out in this troubled economy.<br/>I have a first and second mortgage totaling $145,000 and an approximate low-end appraised value at $116,500.  I have a good and steady income stream in the petroleum transportation industry as a Pipeliner/Operator. My average monthly gross income is $8400. In case of job lost, I plan on utilizing the $115,789 in my savings to pay off some of the outstanding debt.  I plan on keeping this loan to full term.

As I have fully disclosed, my successful participation over the last 21/2 years in a DMP has resulted in the &ldquo;pay-off&rdquo; of over $31,000 of debt since January 1, 2009.  Notwithstanding the reported closure/cancellation of participating accounts,<br/><br/>My &ldquo;credit worthiness&rdquo; has been established over the course of my long-reported credit history.<br/>Particularly over the last few years, I have consistently maintained &ldquo;responsible credit management practices&rdquo; that clearly demonstrate that I possess the discipline and income capacity to meet my past, present and future financial obligations.  Investors&rsquo; review of my posted credit history will confirm my consistent payment history.   .  <br/><br/>In addition, my posted current salary is based on well established professional employment (civil service), which provides the type of income stability that investors should demand to assure a very acceptable return on your investment, as contractually agreed to.   <br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration.<br/> Borrower added on 09/20/11 > DMP - FULL DISCLOSURE<br/><br/>On January 1, 2009, I held 11 active and &ldquo;current&rdquo; credit card/installment accounts totaling slightly over $38,000.  I wanted to consolidate the 11 separate account payments into one single, manageable payment to be made under better terms agreed to by the 11 creditors.  After evaluating my options, I determined that, rather than try to deal with each creditor individually; I &ldquo;voluntarily&rdquo; and &ldquo;responsibly&rdquo; entered into a Debt Management Plan (DMP) with the 11 creditors.  Under the DMP, the 11 participating creditors agreed to reduce interest rates and min. payments&hellip;and the 11 separate account payments were consolidated into one manageable payment of $1,174/mon. (includes $35/mon. fee)&hellip;.. Part of the deal agreed to by the 11 creditors under their accepted participation in the DMP, was the cancellation of the 11 &ldquo;current&rdquo; accounts, and updating of my Credit Report by including the following statement for each participating account:  &ldquo;account canceled/closed by credit grantor&rdquo;.  Therefore, my Credit Report now shows 11 &ldquo;current&rdquo; accounts with this inserted statement.  However, my Credit Report now also reflects the fact that, 8 of the 11 accounts are reported as; &ldquo;paid-in-full ($0 balance)&rdquo;, as a result of my payment of over $31,000 during the last 21/2 years.  <br/><br/>The remaining 3 of the 11 &ldquo;current&rdquo; accounts have a total remaining balance of about $7,800.  The remaining &ldquo;current&rdquo; DMP accounts include:<br/>BofA Gold Option ($4,670) &ndash; req. min. $204/mon. @ 10% roi.<br/>Wells Fargo Visa ($720) &ndash; req. min. $88/mon @ 10% roi.<br/>Wells Fargo Personal ($2,380) &ndash; req. min. $125/mon. @ 10% roi.<br/> Borrower added on 09/23/11 > FINAL THOUGHTS FOR INVESTORS' CONSIDERATION<br/><br/>See It.......Feel It.......Trust It<br/>null",debt_consolidation,REORGANIZATION/CONSOLIDATION,958xx,CA,12.45,1.0,Aug-82,1.0,19.0,,4.0,0.0,0.0,17.78%,30.0,f,0.0,0.0,26529.30003,26455.61,18000.0,8529.3,0.0,0.0,0.0,Jan-15,8803.4,,Apr-17,0.0,,1.0,Individual,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cash,N,,,,,,

But please answer these two questions first please:<br/><br/><br/>1. Do you hold the title to your home on *your own name*<br/><br/><br/>2. How much equity do you have on your house? (please provide the home valuation and total balance of the mortgage/heloc loans)<br/><br/>Member_595101, Thank you for your question and possible financing.  To answer your questions, my home loan is in my husband and my name and is currently $127,299 with $747,00 of the $1,585 going to the principle.  We have been paying on the loan for 15 years give or take a year, and refinanced mainly to lower the years of the loan.  The property was last valued at $575,000 several years ago but that was before the crash.  We can still get at least $300,000-$400,000 concervatively.  I have set aside $900.00 in my bank account provided which is sperate from the family budget in order to pay the monthly payments.  Sorry for the delay in answering your question.  Have a nice day.<br/> Borrower added on 06/03/10 > In the notes section, lending club suggests to offer information regarding on how I will pay back this loan, stable employment, what makes me a good borrower, and monthly budget.<br/><br/>Stable Employment:  I started working at 15 Â½ and have only been unemployed once in my life.  I was laid off due to a buyout of my employer, a major financial institution.  At that time it was good news since a severance package afforded me to stay home with my new baby, as well a return to college for a Microsoft Certification Program. I received my MCSE certification and began working for an IT Company where I worked for 9 Â½ years.  During the 9 Â½ years I moved up the chain and eventually transferred to an account that supported the City.  I was promoted to Network/Server Manager but transferred to my current position when there was an opening.  So realistically, I have been at this current location for over 11 years.  Five years doesnât sound very creditable.<br/> <br/>Good Borrower:  For years I had a credit rating of over 820-840s, and want it back.  I allowed myself to be unselfish and naive to loan funds that were never repaid.  I just want this debt paid off and plan to look into helping others through this type of funding.  What a great opportunity.<br/><br/>Monthly Budget:  I have set aside $450.00 bi-monthly which will cover this payment.  <br/><br/>How will I use this loan:  It will be used to consolidate my credit cards and I will be able to pay a lower interest rate, which can be paid off in 3 years.<br/><br/>Thank you!!<br/>",debt_consolidation,Consolidate SZ8J4F,917xx,CA,11.72,3.0,Aug-86,0.0,3.0,,15.0,0.0,32169.0,60.90%,24.0,f,0.0,0.0,21168.21634,20808.95,18150.0,3018.22,0.0,0.0,0.0,Nov-11,2775.21,,Jun-18,0.0,,1.0,Individual,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cash,N,,,,,,

The simple truth is that prior to my current job, and as with many other people working in High-Tech at the time, my family was a casualty of the dot-com bubble-burst in the early 2000&rsquo;s. In the four years leading up to my current job, I was unemployed for over two years (cumulative), and underemployed for well over a year (the high-tech industry in my state was one of the hardest hit and slowest to recover). It was during that time that I accumulated the vast majority of my current debt, just trying to keep my family afloat.<br/><br/>Originally, the debt was around $65,000, and in the first couple of years with my current employer I had reduced it to around $40,000. The choice to purchase a home for my family two years ago (regretfully, just prior to the real-estate bubble bursting) contributed to its current level.<br/> <br/>And as I mentioned before, it is critically important for me to reduce this debt to zero by the time my daughter enters college, in order to free up my income to apply to her education.

I know this is why we grew during the recession when most other fitness programs went out of business.<br/><br/>Specifically this money would go to several advertising programs, with a good portion of it going to a new website. I think a well organized web site is key for growth. My vision for the new site is one that has exceptional navigation, a clean design, clear content, video's of what we do and how we are different, as well as easy to fill out sign up forms and effortless payment options. Since visibility is key I want to purchase and sell our custom tee shirts. Our designs are easy to read and look great, ensuring they are often worn by clients around town. To date these tee's have given us a great deal of advertising while making our current clients feel special. The balance of the money will be used for new promotional pieces, local advertising, and PR. <br/><br/> We have always paid our employee's, independent contractors, and service providers on time. We have never had an outstanding bill or billing issue. We are in good standing with our bank as well as with our two business credit cards, never having a payment or credit issue. We have successfully and with ease rented offices and studio space. We have worked closely with local cities and been approved to rent space in city owned property. <br/><br/>In the seven years I have ran my company I have always had solid cash flow and never needed to take other work.

STOCKS…  I’d like to secure a loan for part of the down payment on my first home purchase. Recent economic events have resulted in a “buzzcut” for my savings/brokerage account. I’m trying to avoid liquidating securities that are currently 35% plus in the red. While I don’t expect these stocks to return to value overnight, I do expect them to reach closer to baseline in the next couple of years. I’d prefer to keep the savings/securities and not take the large loss and/or pay fees in order to make the down payment.  SMART CHOICE - MITIGATING LOSS  I have secured private financing and have an accepted offer on a bank-owned condo. I would like to make the down payment without liquidating battered stocks.   FIRST TIME BUYER TAX CREDIT…  Please note…I am entitled to the “first time buyer tax credit.” I will place the tax credit in an interest bearing checking account and use it to pay off the LendingClub loan each month. I will do this because, while according to myfico I have a “good to excellent” credit score, I have a relatively “thin” credit file as a result of my history of paying for everything in cash.   INVESTING IN MY FUTURE…  Within the last couple of years, while researching the home buying process, I realized the importance of having an established diversified credit history. As a result, during this period, I opened a couple of credit cards and recently established relationships with credit unions. As I’m lacking tangible “installment” loan history…this loan will result in a more attractive credit portfolio for future potential lenders and allow me to keep my rainy-day savings in my brokerage account.  SAVING MONEY…  With the purchase of this home, my mortgage payments will be significantly less than my current rent and comparable rents for the area. The condo is much closer to work and public transportation is easily accessible. Money for auto maintenance, cost of vehicle wear and tear, fuel costs, insurance cost, and most importantly…time will be saved with this purchase.   “FREE” RENT…  My current rental payment track history obviously shows I’ll be able to more than meet my future mortgage obligation. However, after the home purchase, I will find a roommate to rent a bedroom. A roommate is not a necessity…but the idea is a roommate will allow me to save and invest an additional $450 a month. The rent/utilities the roommate pays will almost completely satisfy my mortgage, tax, insurance, and HOA obligation. My living expenses will be close to zero.  SAFE BET…  I have a secure job that pays a decent wage and pays my medical, dental, disability/life insurance, etc. As a result of my father’s advice to always pay cash, my DTI is very low. While I know my father would advise against this, I believe this loan will save me a significant amount of money in the long run.

I helped my mother refi her house in 2007 while my oldest brother was living with her and helping her out.  In April 2009 he got extremely sick and we almost lost him.  While he was still under medical care they found colon cancer and after surgery he had a major stroke.  We lost him on 9-7-09.  During this time my mother was trying her best to continue to pay her bills but she was on a fixed civil service retirement and it was a struggle.  We helped out as much as we could but then my husband lost his job after 10 years.  She had started a loan modification which was still in process. In April 2010, she was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer and it was terminal.  She had a mastectomy in 2008 but apparently it came back. We lost her on 8-3-10.  During this time we were living in a rental house and was making rent payments.  I was not able to move into this house until December 2010 but by this time the house payments were already 11 months behind.  My husband is now back to work and we are able to make the regular house payments but not the back payments.  We are looking for assistance is this area.  My mother raised 3 children as a single mother in this house since 1967 and we would be devastated to lose it so please help us.  I have been employed with the County of San Diego for almost 30 years and still have at least another 6 years before retirement so making these payments for 60 months will not be an issue.  I also successfully completed a previous loan from Lending Club so I find this avenue very appealing.  I appreciate your consideration and hopefully can live the rest of my days in my family home.

To pay off an old loan with an unfavourably high APR of 24.99%. The payoff amount for this loan is $4,039 (as of 12/22/11, the date this loan would potentially fund).<br><br>2. For home repairs. My condo received some water damage during Hurricane Irene, which was worsened by rain storms during the following months. The entire building was affected and the condo board is co-ordinating repairs to finish in Spring 2012, but in order to cover the costs of this, each unit owner is requested to pay a special assessment in January 2012. My share of this is $4,164.<br><br>3. The remainder of the loan is to finance home improvements which I plan to coincide with the repairs in order to take advantage of the contractors already being there, and save some money. I plan to add a room and upgrade my rusting old boiler for an on-demand one to be more energy efficient. Quotes I've received for this range from $4,000-$5,000, so the total loan amount leaves a little buffer in case of unforeseen extra costs during the work, which is usually the case when dealing with contractors!<br><br>I am an executive with a very stable job for a company that is well-insulated from the economic problems.

My reasoning for wanting a loan vs. paying cash is that I want to keep my security by having liquid assets. <br/><br/>This also means if I were to loose my job (something I do not foresee happening anytime soon) I will have enough money in savings to pay back this loan for 7 months without any financial hardship.<br/>",car,Used Dodge Diesel Tow Rig,950xx,CA,2.79,1.0,Dec-99,0.0,17.0,,5.0,0.0,4811.0,20%,8.0,f,0.0,0.0,9153.551721,9153.55,8000.0,1153.55,0.0,0.0,0.0,Aug-13,1420.77,,Aug-13,0.0,,1.0,Individual,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cash,N,,,,,,

This does not cover the full amount of my outstanding debt, so I'll be making the minimum payments here until the slightly higher interest loans are paid off, then I'll shift to paying this off more expeditiously.  I expect this loan to be paid off in 2 years or less, but for that shorter investment time you get a lower risk investment.  In the past 15 years of credit history, I have never missed a payment on any loan.  I have a graduate degree with a highly secure job and corresponding high income and upward mobility.  Even in the current economy I am approached with job offers every month or two from competitors and clients alike so there is very little risk to my income - or your investment.

Furthermore, the territory I have negotiated to purchase is a perfect fit with over 60,000 of our target households.  Our business is going to experience explosive growth immediately, as the area is growing faster than the schools can build.  It is a perfect time for us to step in with a proven system that provides a service that is in high demand and short supply--right now. Please help us get started as soon as possible, so this opportunity doesn’t go to someone with cash in hand.  We may not be rich, but we are passionate about children, education, the arts and our community.  There is no better team than my wife and I to build this business right here, right now.

Resultantly, I am being charged outrageous interest rates on some cards and am looking to consolidate these loans at 10%.  My annual salary as an agent with Allstate is $50,000 including commissions, my home payment is $1,200 monthly, however I do have two tenants paying $800 so my monthly outflow, with a $100 monthly car payment, is quite low.  I am the eldest of 18 children and am well used to sacrifice, so getting these paid on time is not a problem.  I am already driving a 98 Honda Civic, and am perfectly willing to eat Top Ramen to pay these cards off.  All I need is an opportunity.  You will not regret it.  My goals are to purchase my parents a home, and to purchase at least 5 Allstate agencies.  I currently manage my current office.

And during the 5 years of my success in the public eye, most likely due to my lack of experience and preparedness, financially I made a few errors in judgment.      Since then I have been doing everything I can to improve my financial situation: I got a very good job at the University of California, San Diego managing several projects in Medical Education (4 years currently); I???ve been pushing aggressively for promotions at work (about 1 month away from the latest approval); I am currently in the pursuit of a second job;  I have been and continue to sell items of value in order to supplement any income; To save money on gas, I bike to work on average 1-2 times per week (approximately 50 miles round trip); and most importantly, I have turned music into a more realistic and financially stable hobby.      Below is the detail of the debt that I am hoping to consolidate.   I plan on eliminating 3 of the 4 cards.   In the years that I have had this debt, I have been late on payments maybe once or twice (occasions where I overlooked the date).  Also, a little less than one-third of this debt was built from the assistance of pursuing my bachelor???s degree.        * indicates the credit I intend on eliminating with this assistance      Card 1  $3902.38 (%15.24)      * Card 2  $3955.99 (%17.90)      *Card 3  $13,475.70 (%24.50)      *Card 4  $4777.13   (%27.74)      I appreciate any help that is out there and look forward to getting out of this hole so I can finally be able to focus on moving forward with building a family and career.

I would be extremely grateful if you would help me out of a high-interest credit card situation. I have been with my employer full-time for over 14 years. I usually pay more than the minimum on my credit cards, so if I can consolidate my payments into one I will be able to pay off my debt sooner. I have the money taken straight out of my checking account so I am never late. I paid back all of my student loans and I recently finished paying off my car. I have been successful in having some of my interest rates lowered, although not very much and with revolving interest rates. In any case, I would prefer to give my money to people who are willing to help each other out. I am eager to get out of debt, so again, thank you in advance for your help!<br/> Borrower added on 06/28/10 > Hello and thank you for your questions. I intend to pay back this loan in the same way that I am currently paying back my credit cards. I am able to pay the monthly notes due, but with a flat rate it will be easier to budget over the long term. I applied for the total balance of my debt but the loan offered was for the listed amount, which I accepted. I've never done this before, so I don't know if it would have helped to wait until after payday when my bills are automatically paid and the total debt obviously would be a bit lower. Although I won't be able to completely consolidate all my debts into one, the loan will go to completely pay off the highest interest card and partially pay the next-highest card which is on a revolving interest, so my payments there will actually go a longer way. Even if my total monthly payments out remains the same a larger portion will actually be paying down my debt and I will be debt free much sooner. I use a Discover card for my monthly expenses to keep track of where my money goes and that I pay in full each month. I acquired most of the debt after a long-term relationship breakup over a year ago. My bills suddenly doubled and it took a while for me to sort out my finances and make lifestyle changes that would allow me to be able to handle living on my own on my salary. I had a car payment at the time that I do not have now, so that goes to paying back my debts as well. My job is secure, I know where my money goes each month, and I know that this loan is well within my budget. In fact, it is lower than what I currently pay monthly on my high-interest credit card. Thank you to the people who have funded the loan so far. It is in my best interest as well, so I will make sure that you get your investment back.<br/>",debt_consolidation,people not banks,787xx,TX,11.19,0.0,Jun-89,1.0,,,14.0,0.0,13972.0,20.20%,23.0,f,0.0,0.0,6922.93821,6922.94,6250.0,672.94,0.0,0.0,0.0,Jul-13,216.43,,Jul-13,0.0,,1.0,Individual,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cash,N,,,,,,

The high interest rate on my cards forces me to pay more towards interest and less towards the principal amounts owed - this fact makes it extremely hard to get anywhere with my creditors.  In my ten years of credit history, I have never had a late payment or missed payment mark against my credit history.    My goal is to use the funding I receive to pay off these high interest rate cards, have the benefit of a lower interest rate with a single payment to Lending Club, continue to ""snow-ball"" my savings to pay my Lending Club lenders, and to be debt free by three years.  This plan should afford me the opportunity to send my child to private school at that time and help improve the quality of life for my family.

The property, a 4-bedroom single family home, is located in Richmond, Virginia's up and coming Church Hill neighborhood.<br/><br/>I currently have funds to purchase the property in cash, without the need for a mortgage, but am short of funds needed for light rehab work to make the property safe and comfortable enough for a family to call home. The home inspection revealed some unanticipated issues that I would like to resolve before renting the property. Qualified contractors will be hired to perform a majority of the work due to personal time constraints with my job.<br/><br/>Assuming a conservative estimate for rental rate and operating costs, income generated on the property should greatly exceed expenses.  As a result, I will likely repay this loan in full prior to the end of the term.<br/><br/>A bit more about me: I am a C-level executive at an Inc 500 company where I have worked for the past 4 years.  I was the first employee hired by the owner and together we have grown the company from 2 to 18 employees, remaining profitable each year even in the current dour economic climate.<br/><br/>I have a BS in chemistry and an MS in technology management (similar to an MBA with a technology focus).

For hopeful lenders or those who are skeptical on investing in my loan, please ask me any questions that may be useful for your decision. I need at least 80% (6,000) in order to accept any offer. This would be enough to pay off my credit card with the highest balance and the highest interest rate. The min payment on this credit card alone is $200 and I'm currently paying $400-$500 every month and it seems like these payments are taking the balance nowhere:( It is really discouraging. Paying off just this credit would help a ton and the loan payment will be much less than I'm already paying. Paying off all of my credit cards would be even better, but those balances aren't outrageous and still managable. Your help in funding would be a true blessing and relief.

I will be more than happy to clarify. First I am asking for a loan to consolidate my debt, I'm currently paying on about 8 different cards every month and my interest rate on some of them is really high; so I would like to consolidate them all into one loan with one interest payment. As of now I am currently paying about $525.00 a month on my credit cards, at the end of august that will drop to about $300.00 a month because I will be done with 3 of them. My goal is to pay off my debt as soon as possible I always pay on time and more than the minimum. The reason I need the loan is not because I can't afford to pay but to simply pay it off faster. With the current plan in place of me making payment of $230.00 for 3 years I will be able to make additional payment a month to pay this loan off faster. So to answer your question I do plan on paying this loan off early, hopefully in about 2yrs or less. I know that credit is tough to get now days because of the economy and  lending money now carries a higher risk for the lender, but I have never defaulted on any of my credit cards, nor on anything thing else. I always pay all of my bills on time and if possible I pay some in advance long before they are due. Also another thing is that I work for the City of North Richland Hills, I am currently employed there as a Detention Officer, it is a civil service job so it does take a lot for someone to be laid off or fired. I make the same if not more money every month, but I never make less. Currently I&rsquo;m making about $1932.00 net a month the only payments that I have are my monthly rent of $459.00 Utilities about $150.00 and my cell phone and internet of about $135.00 and currently the $525.00 on my credit cards. Once I consolidate my cards into one loan I will be more than able to pay for this loan. Currently I also attend Tarrant County College at the end of the fall semester I will be testing for the Police Officer Position my chances of getting hire on as a Police Officer are very high due to the fact that I already work here, so once I become and Officer my pay will also go up and that will allow me to pay of my loan even faster. In the chance that I don't become an Officer this year I still plan on paying off this loan in Less than 2yrs. I hope that I have answered any and all questions so that you all will be able to make a more informed decision. Thank you for your time and show of interest in me, if you have any more questions I will be more than happy to answer them. Thank you again.<br/>",other,Carlos Loan,760xx,TX,12.37,0.0,Apr-07,0.0,,,10.0,0.0,6547.0,57.40%,12.0,f,0.0,0.0,8024.326389,8024.33,6300.0,1724.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,Jul-13,232.67,,Dec-17,0.0,,1.0,Individual,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cash,N,,,,,,

While the numbers crunch out to a D2 loan, let me take you beyond the numbers and show you how this is not your typical D2 loan.  The funds from this loan will be used strictly to pay down debts which carry significantly higher interest rates.  I experienced some life events in the past that caused the current situation.  I have worked hard to improve credit score and pay down the debts but with the interest rates so high its a real struggle.  I have been employed for 15 years with the same company (Fortune 50) so I have a stable work history.  As a result of my steady work history, I do not miss a payment which is one of the reasons why I qualify for this loan.  My current budget for debt repayment is $1,300 and this loan will reduce that to about $800 which will free up much needed cash to pay down the remainder of my debt faster and ensure that I provide you the return on your investment as agreed.  I am a good borrower because I have a steady history of paying my bills on time, very stable work history, clearly can afford the payments and I much rather pay you the not-so-great interest of 17% than to pay a greedy, unscrupulous giant credit card company.

I had a line of credit with another bank that Bank of America acquired. I paid this off in full when it was moved to BOA. Upon paying this off BOA reduced the line of credit by 10,000, which caused my available credit to dip and as a result my credit score took a hit. The next month I was a day late with a payment and BOA decided due to that and the credit score they were going to raise my APR from 11% to 29% for 6 months, with raised payments.

Last summer, I started researching pet sitting/dog walking as an alternative business, because I would like to stay within my home area.  I became interested in pet sitting by the way of managing bed and breakfasts for owners who want vacations, take medical leave, etc. They also have pets. I took care of these pets along with daily walks.  In December of 2007, I tentatively opened for business. I know from my research that banks will not loan to me as there is no overhead or building that I am renting or buying.  What I am looking for is marketing and personal finance money to get me through the next three months. I do have jobs lined up for summer, but right now I have two big marketing shows lined up and need the financing now.  I feel if I focus my time on marketing aggressively, (door to door, trade shows, fairs, meetings with vets, groomers, mailings) I can reach my goal by summer.  I have ran the numbers and technically if I get 4-6  dogs or cats a day on a routine basis I can have a fully operational and viable business. There are 42,000 licensed dog owners in my county alone. 10,000 that are not licensed and most of these live in apartments, where my business can be a great asset.

Founded in 1984 Tropical Sno specializes in the highest quality shaved ice products.  Today there are more than 1,000 independent dealers in over 30 countries around the world.  Completely different than cheap snow cones sold at festivals, Tropical Sno produces the finest snow with real to life flavors, not cheap cough syrupy tasting flavors.  This is the kind of product parents buy initially for their kids and then once they've tasted it, come back for their own.  It is truly amazing the amount of repeat business this product creates.<br/>For three years I have worked with this company and sold this opportunity to regular people hoping to get their feet in the business ownership world and supplement their income.  In my own experience the results have been astounding.  One person I sold and helped get started last year sent me the following thank you card, &quot;Clint, thank you so much for introducing me to this amazing company!  It has been the greatest investment I have ever made!!!  In just four months we have returned more than $30,000!!!  We love Tropical Sno and we are so happy with this decision!!  We look forward to working together for many more years.&quot;<br/>This reaction is not uncommon with Tropical Sno dealers.  Though business ownership is not for everyone I have never seen one of our dealers lose money in this business.  The average start up cost is around $20,000 and the average gross take home is just over $30,000 a year.  With product costs at only 10% and total operating costs under 50%, many of our dealers turn a profit in their very first year.  Some decide after a year that it is not for them.  These dealers simply sell their equipment as used for what they owe or even a little more.  This is why I have never seen anyone lose money in this business.  It is truly a home run.  <br/>Not only am I and my wife eager to start our own dealership but as the sales director for this company I am thrilled with The Lending Club so I can refer many others to this great funding option.  <br/>If that doesn't speak for itself, I have been selling this opportunity for three years and am now eagerly look forward to buying into it myself.  I have seen so many ordinary people create extraordinary results with Tropical Sno.  <br/>I am not reinventing the wheel.  I am starting a business that thousands have done before.  I know why some do good and other do exceptional.  I know the marketing tricks that many of our dealers implement.  Every contact I have in this business; owners, distributors, dealers and customers say there is no better small business to own.  I truly can't wait to own my own.  <br/>This summer I will open my doors for business in a fantastic location we have secured.

To date I have designed and installed my personal stereo in my previously owned vehicle. That system consisted of a new head unit, all new mids & highs, dual subwoofers and  dual amplifiers to power both the subs and rear 6x9's. My other passion within audio electronics is designing and building custom drivers. To date I have designed and built multiple custom prototypes for my personal use. The training and certification that Mobile Dynamics offers will allow me to begin full-time work and career development within the field of mobile electronics. At this time I am able to cover a portion of the required costs of attendance and plan to continue my part-time work while receiving  the Mobile Dynamics certification.

My wife is unemployed but graduated with a Bachelor's in Fisheries and Wildlife Biology.  I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science.  I am a Software Engineer for ClearPointe Technology and have been for over 3 years.  Before that, I was a Software Developer for Acxiom Corporation.  My current employer is currently experiencing a great deal of growth as the service we provide for our customers, managed IT services, saves the customer money and has been very popular during the recession.  Our company has bought and integrated 3 other companies in the past year.  I currently build and maintain several key systems at my company and have committed to this growing company for the long-haul.  I receive a base salary, that is very adequate for the needs of my wife and me.<br/>* Other debt I currently have besides the $9000 or so in credit cards include two small student loans from my wife at an extremely low interest rate ($10,000 at &lt; 4%, ~$100/mo), a car payment ($9,000 at 6.5%, ~$280/mo), and a mortgage payment ($102,000 at 4.375%, ~650/mo).  <br/>* Although I plan to pay this loan off more quickly than 3 years, and that could lower the amount of money you make, by funding this loan you will be helping me get out of debt quicker, and give more free money to save for my wife and I possibly having a child one day.  Also, both my wife and my parents are also in poor financial shape and we would be able to increase the amount of assistance that we are able to provide for them.

Status:Fully Paid,n,,"Hello :)    I am looking for a loan to help me pay off high interest credit cards.    I make a goo living, and never have a problem paying my credit cards.. and alway  on time. and always a bit more than the minimum.  I was looking at a debt calculator, and realized it would take me years..even decades to pay off the cards, and ending up having to pay so much extra money in interest in that time.  WHY would I do that when I can hopefully get a loan, pay just about what I am paying now, and be done with it in 3 years.   I understand my credit grade below doesn't look like I am a good risk.  I have discussed my scores and why I received this grade with a finance counselor - it is  because of my debt ratio/usage of credit accounts.  My payment history and age of accounts scored an A.  I understand the value of good credit - which is why you are reading thsi now. I can and WILL payback on time.. something you hopefully soon find out :)  I have been employed at the same company in the Bay Area for 7 years (in May).  It's a great job - one which I have no plans on leaving.  I opted not to list the name of the company on my profile, but would be willing to share if you were to contact me.

I need to retain the services of a skilled lawyer to litigate for more favorable visitation terms, as I'll explain.  My girls have their primary residence with their mother (my ex) 1,000 miles away.  I fly out to see them every 6 weeks during the school year, and they visit me for two three-week periods during the summer.  My girls originally accompanied my ex to Missouri when she mobilized with the U.S. Army Reserve.  I lost the injunction to keep them with me in Northern Virginia during the period of mobilization.  My ex's argument was that, while mobilized, her job would be that of a classroom instructor, and having the girls accompany her would preserve the status quo (she was a stay-at-home mom before our divorce).  The judge agreed.  My ex has since demobilized, but has elected to make Missouri her permanent home.  That means there's been a material change in circumstance, so I've filed a motion to secure an enduring custody & visitation agreement.  My chief goal is to expand summer visitation to 8 continuous weeks so I can get the girls into activities near my home and do all the daddy/daughter things I miss out on during the rest of the year.  I'm also going to challenge my ex on her attempts at parental alienation.  I am a career Army officer; I'll be promoted to lieutenant colonel in February, so my future income is assured.

We have one child in elementary school close to our current home and the other attends school where there is a program for children with Autism.  We plan to relocate closer to the school with the autism program and save over an hour commute each day and hundreds of dollars in gas money each month.  Additionally, we could save another $400-500 per month in rent from what we are currently paying now .<br/><br/><br/>The secondary reason for our loan request is when I applied with Lending Club for the moving loan, I was offered a larger loan at a lower interest rate than I am paying on most of my credit cards.  By paying off those high interest cards with a debt-elimination plan I should be able to raise my FICO scores even higher and actually save money with this new loan each month.  The entire cost of this new loan is lower than the monthly payments on the credit cards we will paying off.  This actually lowers our DTI ratio.  These two things are very important to us as we will plan to purchase a home within the next 2-3 years.  Saving money towards a down payment, keeping a high FICO score and lowering our DTI ratio is our plan to homeownership.<br/><br/>We have those high credit card interest rates because of an 8 year old bankruptcy I filed after my wife and I lost our high paying jobs in 2001 during the dot.com bust.  My wife was 6 months pregnant at the time of the double layoffs and our COBRA benefits were cancelled when her former employer ceased to exist as a business.  This happened one month before delivery and we were not covered by any insurance when the baby was born.  Bankruptcy was recommended to us by an attorney as a solution to our high medical debt.  It was a short term fix with long term consequences that cost us a lot over the years.  If ever I found myself in that kind of dire situation again, I would exhaust everything else before ever doing another bankruptcy.<br/><br/>I believe our loan is a great investment.   It&rsquo;s a win for us because we will be able to move closer to our young son&rsquo;s school and save hundreds of dollars each month.  It&rsquo;s a win for you because it&rsquo;s a high return on a low risk family.<br/> Borrower added on 07/20/10 > UPDATE:  LC's underwriter informed us that since we don't have any unsecured debt owed to a single creditor in the neighborhood of $16,000 the max amount they are letting us borrow is $6000.  In other words - we don't owe anyone else that much money (not including car loans, past mortgages, or past HELOCs).  I always thought that was a good thing, but I guess not here.<br/><br/>Disappointing?  You better believe it, especially since it really doesn't make sense.  Enough to cancel the loan that is currently funding at the higher loan amount interest rate?  No, we are grateful to those who have put their trust in us and have offered to fund our loan.  We will not disappoint you.  Moving closer to our 4 year old autistic son's school ASAP is our priority right now.  This loan will help accomplish that, and it will still save us hundreds of dollars in gas and premium rent that we are paying now.  In six months I will be able to re-apply for another Lending Club loan that will take care of the debt consolidation if that is something I still need to do at that time.  A perfect Lending Club payment history should go a long way towards softening the underwriters (We hope).

Since she loves working with animals, this seemed like the right way to do it. She learns best by doing, hands on and this program offers an excellent teacher-student ratio of 1 teacher for 6 students and most of her studies will be geared towards how she learns, by actually doing it.

Over the last 8.5 years I have found many opportunities for improvement in shipping, tracking, handling, processing & a way to ensure Quality Control over the Vendors billing. Over the years as technology has progressed I have found that the oil companies still rely too much on personnel to track these said items & vendors to be honest about the return dates of quite high dollar items. This has been & can be a costly mistake which I know being an insider to the industry that I can capitalize on.  Iâm looking for funds to turn my Logistics Concept that I have been working on over the last 4 years into a reality.
